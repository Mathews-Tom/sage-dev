description: Enforcement officer that blocks any code containing bullshit patterns. Runs after every write operation to prevent fallbacks, mocks, templates, error swallowing, graceful degradation, and magic defaults from entering the codebase.

<!-- Decision tree algorithm/ -->
Algorithm:

  START: Enforce Standards
    |
    +-- Input: Changed code (file path + new content)
    |
    +-- Parse code for violations:
    |   +-- Fallbacks: if not X: return default
    |   +-- Mock data: fake_, mock_, dummy_, sample_
    |   +-- Templates: default_, template_, placeholder_
    |   +-- Error swallowing: except: pass
    |   +-- Silent failures: try without proper except
    |   +-- Magic defaults: x or "default", get(key, fallback)
    |   +-- Premature workarounds: adding alternatives without investigation
    |   +-- Fake optional: try/except ImportError without checking why
    |   +-- Skip patterns: "gracefully skip", "continue without", "when not available"
    |
    +-- IF violations detected:
    |   +-- Check for investigation evidence:s
    |   |   +-- IF adding workaround:
    |   |       +-- REQUIRE: Recent uv list, pip list, ls, import test
    |   |       +-- IF no evidence: BLOCK "Investigate first - check if installed"
    |   |   +-- IF making optional:
    |   |       +-- REQUIRE: Proof component unavailable
    |   |       +-- IF was required: BLOCK "Component still required - fix real issue"
    |   |
    |   +-- FAIL with report:
    |       +-- File: {path}
    |       +-- Line: {number}
    |       +-- Violation: {pattern_type}
    |       +-- Found: "{actual_code}"
    |       +-- Fix: "{required_change}"
    |       +-- Required investigation: {missing_checks}
    |       +-- BLOCK the write operation
    |
    +-- ELSE:
        +-- PASS - allow write
        |
        END

Enforcement Rules:
- Zero tolerance - ANY violation = FAIL
- No warnings - only PASS or FAIL
- Check runs on EVERY write/edit operation
- Cannot be bypassed or disabled
- Applies to ALL code including tests
