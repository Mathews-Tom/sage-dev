Algorithm:

  START: Documentation Validation
    |
    +-- Initialize
    |   +-- Get all Python files in changeset
    |   +-- Define docstring standards
    |   +-- Create validation report
    |
    +-- FOR each Python file:
    |   |
    |   +-- Parse AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
    |   |
    |   +-- Extract definitions:
    |   |   +-- Module-level docstring
    |   |   +-- Class definitions
    |   |   +-- Function definitions
    |   |   +-- Method definitions
    |   |
    |   +-- FOR each definition:
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check if public (not starting with _):
    |   |   |   +-- IF private: SKIP
    |   |   |   +-- IF public: VALIDATE
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Extract docstring:
    |   |   |   +-- IF missing:
    |   |   |   |   +-- VIOLATION: "Missing docstring"
    |   |   |   |   +-- Severity: ERROR
    |   |   |   |   +-- Element: {type} {name} at line {lineno}
    |   |   |   |
    |   |   |   +-- IF present:
    |   |   |       +-- Parse docstring format
    |   |   |       +-- Validate structure
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Validate function/method docstring:

    |   |   |   +-- Check summary line:
    |   |   |   |   +-- First line must be one-line summary
    |   |   |   |   +-- Must end with period
    |   |   |   |   +-- Must be imperative mood (not "This function...")
    |   |   |   |   +-- IF invalid:
    |   |   |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "Invalid summary line"

    |   |   |   |       +-- IF type hint present: OK
    |   |   |   |       +-- IF no type hint:
    |   |   |   |           +-- REQUIRE type in docstring
    |   |   |   |           +-- Format: "param_name (type): description"

Rules:

- All public functions/classes/methods must have docstrings
- Google-style docstring format required
- Summary line must be imperative mood, end with period
- All parameters must be documented (Args section)
- Return values must be documented (Returns section)
- Raised exceptions should be documented (Raises section)
- Type information via type hints preferred over docstring types
- No placeholder text (TODO, FIXME, TBD) in production
- Module-level docstrings required for all files
- Class attributes should be documented (Attributes section)
- Complex functions should include Examples section
- Auto-fix generates template, requires manual completion
- STRICT mode blocks on missing/incomplete docstrings
- BALANCED mode warns, allows to proceed
- PROTOTYPE mode logs only

Docstring Template (Function):
"""
<One-line summary ending with period.>

<Extended description if needed.>

Args:
    param1 (type): Description of param1.
    param2 (type): Description of param2.

Returns:
    type: Description of return value.

Raises:
    ValueError: Description of when this is raised.
    TypeError: Description of when this is raised.

Examples:
    >>> function_name(param1, param2)
    expected_result
"""

Docstring Template (Class):
"""
<One-line summary ending with period.>

<Extended description if needed.>

Attributes:
    attr1 (type): Description of attr1.
    attr2 (type): Description of attr2.

Examples:
    >>> obj = ClassName()
    >>> obj.method()
    expected_result
"""

Severity Levels:

- ERROR: Critical issue, blocks in STRICT mode
- WARNING: Important issue, should be fixed
- INFO: Recommendation, non-blocking

Enforcement Actions:

- BLOCK: Prevent operation, require fix
- WARN: Log warning, allow to proceed
- LOG: Record for reference only
- AUTO_FIX: Generate template docstring (manual completion required)
