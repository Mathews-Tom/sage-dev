Algorithm:

  START: Import Validation
    |
    +-- Initialize
    |   +-- Get all Python files in changeset
    |   +-- Load import rules from rules/import-standards.md
    |   +-- Build project dependency graph
    |
    +-- FOR each Python file:
    |   |
    |   +-- Parse imports:
    |   |   +-- Standard library imports
    |   |   +-- Third-party imports
    |   |   +-- Local/project imports
    |   |   +-- Extract import statements and locations
    |   |
    |   +-- Check import placement:
    |   |   +-- REQUIRE: All imports at top of file
    |   |   +-- EXCEPT: After module docstring
    |   |   +-- EXCEPT: After from __future__ import
    |   |   +-- IF import in function/class body:
    |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "Import not at module level"
    |   |       +-- Location: {function/class} at line {lineno}
    |   |       +-- Severity: WARNING
    |   |       +-- Exception: Allowed for circular import resolution (with comment)
    |   |
    |   +-- Validate import style:
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check for wildcard imports:
    |   |   |   +-- Pattern: from module import *
    |   |   |   +-- IF found:
    |   |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "Wildcard import detected"
    |   |   |       +-- Line: {lineno}
    |   |   |       +-- Severity: ERROR
    |   |   |       +-- Fix: Import specific names
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check for relative imports:
    |   |   |   +-- Pattern: from . import, from .. import
    |   |   |   +-- IF found:
    |   |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "Relative import detected"
    |   |   |       +-- Line: {lineno}
    |   |   |       +-- Current: {import_statement}
    |   |   |       +-- Required: Absolute import path
    |   |   |       +-- Severity: ERROR
    |   |   |       +-- Auto-fix: Convert to absolute import
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check for multiple imports per line:
    |   |   |   +-- Pattern: import os, sys
    |   |   |   +-- IF found:
    |   |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "Multiple imports on one line"
    |   |   |       +-- Line: {lineno}
    |   |   |       +-- Fix: Split into separate lines
    |   |   |       +-- Auto-fix: Reformat imports
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check for unused imports:
    |   |       +-- Use AST analysis to find unused imports
    |   |       +-- IF import not used in file:
    |   |           +-- VIOLATION: "Unused import"
    |   |           +-- Import: {import_name}
    |   |           +-- Line: {lineno}
    |   |           +-- Severity: WARNING
    |   |           +-- Auto-fix: Remove unused import
    |   |
    |   +-- Validate import ordering (PEP 8):
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Expected order:
    |   |   |   1. from __future__ imports
    |   |   |   2. Standard library imports
    |   |   |   3. Third-party imports
    |   |   |   4. Local application imports
    |   |   |   (Blank line between each group)
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check group ordering:
    |   |   |   +-- FOR each import:
    |   |   |       +-- Determine group (stdlib, third-party, local)
    |   |   |       +-- Track position
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Validate order:
    |   |   |   +-- IF groups out of order:
    |   |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "Import groups misordered"
    |   |   |       +-- Expected: {expected_order}
    |   |   |       +-- Found: {actual_order}
    |   |   |       +-- Auto-fix: Reorder imports
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check alphabetical sorting within groups:
    |   |   |   +-- FOR each group:
    |   |   |       +-- Check imports sorted alphabetically
    |   |   |       +-- IF not sorted:
    |   |   |           +-- VIOLATION: "Imports not alphabetically sorted"
    |   |   |           +-- Group: {group_name}
    |   |   |           +-- Auto-fix: Sort imports
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check blank lines between groups:
    |   |       +-- REQUIRE: Exactly one blank line between groups
    |   |       +-- IF missing or multiple:
    |   |           +-- VIOLATION: "Missing/extra blank lines"
    |   |           +-- Auto-fix: Normalize spacing
    |   |
    |   +-- Detect circular dependencies:
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Build import graph:
    |   |   |   +-- Node: Current file
    |   |   |   +-- Edges: Imported modules
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Run cycle detection (DFS):
    |   |   |   +-- Track visited nodes
    |   |   |   +-- Track current path
    |   |   |   +-- IF node in current path:
    |   |   |       +-- Circular dependency detected
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- IF cycle found:
    |   |   |   +-- VIOLATION: "Circular import dependency"
    |   |   |   +-- Cycle: {module_a} → {module_b} → {module_a}
    |   |   |   +-- Severity: CRITICAL
    |   |   |   +-- Suggestions:
    |   |   |       +-- Move shared code to separate module

    |   |   |       +-- pandas → pd (standard)
    |   |   |       +-- matplotlib.pyplot → plt (standard)

    |   |   |           +-- Severity: INFO
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check for discouraged imports:

    |   |   |       +-- import* (wildcard)
    |   |   |       +-- __import__ (dynamic imports)
    |   |   |   +-- IF found:
    |   |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "Discouraged import pattern"
    |   |   |       +-- Severity: WARNING
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check for missing __init__.py:

    |   |       +-- Verify __init__.py exists
    |   |       +-- IF missing:

Rules:

- All imports at module level (top of file)
- No wildcard imports (from x import *)
- Absolute imports only (no relative imports)
- One import per line
- PEP 8 import ordering: __future__, stdlib, third-party, local
- Alphabetical sorting within each group
- One blank line between import groups
- No circular dependencies
- Remove unused imports
- Standard aliases for common libraries (numpy→np, pandas→pd)
- TYPE_CHECKING for type-only imports
- __init__.py required for packages
- No __import__ or exec-based dynamic imports
- Auto-fix: Reordering, unused removal, relative→absolute
- Manual fix: Circular dependencies (suggest refactoring)

Import Order (PEP 8):

```python
"""Module docstring."""
from __future__ import annotations

import os
import sys

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from myproject.models import User
from myproject.utils import helper
```

Circular Dependency Resolution Strategies:

1. Move shared code to separate module
2. Use TYPE_CHECKING for type-only imports
3. Import inside function/method (local import)
4. Refactor to break dependency cycle
5. Use dependency injection

Enforcement Actions:

- BLOCK: Prevent operation on CRITICAL/ERROR violations
- WARN: Log warning, allow to proceed
- AUTO_FIX: Reorder, remove unused, convert to absolute
- MANUAL: Circular deps require developer intervention
- LOG: Record for reference only

Dependency Graph Format (.sage/import-graph.json):

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "module_a", "type": "local"},
    {"id": "module_b", "type": "local"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"from": "module_a", "to": "module_b"}
  ],
  "cycles": [
    ["module_a", "module_b", "module_a"]
  ]
}
```
