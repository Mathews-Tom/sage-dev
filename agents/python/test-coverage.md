Algorithm:

  START: Test Coverage Enforcement
    |
    +-- Initialize
    |   +-- Load coverage configuration (.coveragerc or pyproject.toml)
    |   +-- Define minimum thresholds
    |   +-- Get changed files in commit
    |
    +-- Determine coverage tool:
    |   +-- Python: pytest-cov or coverage.py
    |   +-- JavaScript: jest --coverage or nyc
    |   +-- Check tool availability
    |   +-- IF tool missing:
    |       +-- VIOLATION: "Coverage tool not installed"
    |       +-- Guide: Install pytest-cov or coverage.py
    |       +-- BLOCK execution
    |
    +-- Run test suite with coverage:
    |   +-- Execute: pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=json
    |   +-- Capture coverage data
    |   +-- Parse coverage report (JSON format)
    |   +-- IF test failures:
    |       +-- VIOLATION: "Tests failing, cannot assess coverage"
    |       +-- BLOCK: Fix failing tests first
    |       +-- Show test failures
    |
    +-- Analyze coverage metrics:
    |   |
    |   +-- Overall coverage:
    |   |   +-- Total statements: X
    |   |   +-- Covered statements: Y
    |   |   +-- Coverage percentage: (Y/X) *100
    |   |
    |   +-- Per-file coverage:
    |   |   +-- FOR each Python file:
    |   |       +-- Calculate file coverage
    |   |       +-- Identify uncovered lines
    |   |       +-- Track coverage trend (if historical data)
    |   |
    |   +-- Changed files coverage:
    |       +-- FOR each file in changeset:
    |       |   +-- Calculate coverage for new/modified code
    |       |   +-- NEW_CODE_COVERAGE = (covered_new_lines / total_new_lines)* 100
    |       |
    |       +-- Require higher threshold for new code (e.g., 90%)
    |
    +-- Check coverage thresholds:
    |   |
    |   +-- Load thresholds:
    |   |   +-- Overall minimum: 80% (configurable)
    |   |   +-- New code minimum: 90% (configurable)
    |   |   +-- Per-file minimum: 75% (configurable)
    |   |   +-- Critical files: 95% (configurable)
    |   |
    |   +-- Evaluate overall coverage:
    |   |   +-- IF coverage < overall_threshold:
    |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "Overall coverage below threshold"
    |   |       +-- Current: {current_coverage}%
    |   |       +-- Required: {threshold}%
    |   |       +-- Gap: {threshold - current_coverage}%
    |   |
    |   +-- Evaluate new code coverage:
    |   |   +-- IF new_code_coverage < new_code_threshold:
    |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "New code coverage below threshold"
    |   |       +-- Current: {new_code_coverage}%
    |   |       +-- Required: {new_code_threshold}%
    |   |       +-- Uncovered lines: {line_numbers}
    |   |
    |   +-- Evaluate per-file coverage:
    |   |   +-- FOR each file in changeset:
    |   |   |   +-- IF file_coverage < per_file_threshold:
    |   |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "File coverage below threshold"
    |   |   |       +-- File: {path}
    |   |   |       +-- Current: {file_coverage}%
    |   |   |       +-- Required: {per_file_threshold}%
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Check critical files:
    |   |       +-- Critical patterns: core/*, models/*, auth/*
    |   |       +-- IF critical_file_coverage < critical_threshold:
    |   |           +-- VIOLATION: "Critical file under-tested"
    |   |           +-- Severity: CRITICAL
    |   |
    |   +-- Check coverage trend:
    |       +-- IF historical data available:
    |       |   +-- Compare with previous coverage
    |       |   +-- IF coverage decreased:
    |       |       +-- VIOLATION: "Coverage regression detected"
    |       |       +-- Previous: {old_coverage}%
    |       |       +-- Current: {new_coverage}%
    |       |       +-- Delta: {delta}%
    |       |
    |       +-- ELSE: Store current coverage as baseline
    |
    +-- Analyze test quality:
    |   |
    |   +-- Check for test existence:
    |   |   +-- FOR each Python module:
    |   |       +-- Look for corresponding test file
    |   |       +-- Patterns: test_{module}.py, {module}*test.py
    |   |       +-- IF test file missing:
    |   |           +-- VIOLATION: "No test file for module"
    |   |           +-- Module: {module_path}
    |   |           +-- Expected: tests/test*{module}.py
    |   |
    |   +-- Check test patterns:
    |   |   +-- Scan for test anti-patterns:
    |   |   |   +-- Empty tests (pass only)
    |   |   |   +-- Disabled tests (@pytest.mark.skip without reason)
    |   |   |   +-- Tests without assertions
    |   |   |   +-- Overly broad try/except in tests
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- IF anti-pattern found:
    |   |       +-- VIOLATION: "Test anti-pattern detected"
    |   |       +-- Pattern: {pattern_type}
    |   |       +-- Location: {file}:{line}
    |   |       +-- Severity: WARNING
    |   |
    |   +-- Check test organization:
    |       +-- Tests should be in tests/ directory
    |       +-- Test files should start with test_ or end with _test.py
    |       +-- IF organization violation:
    |           +-- VIOLATION: "Test organization issue"
    |           +-- Severity: INFO
    |
    +-- Generate uncovered code report:
    |   |
    |   +-- FOR each file with coverage gaps:
    |   |   +-- List uncovered lines
    |   |   +-- Categorize by type:
    |   |   |   +-- Uncovered branches
    |   |   |   +-- Uncovered statements
    |   |   |   +-- Uncovered functions
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Provide test suggestions:
    |   |       +-- "Add test for: {function_name}"
    |   |       +-- "Cover edge case: {scenario}"
    |   |       +-- "Test error path at line {line}"
    |   |
    |   +-- Generate coverage diff:
    |       +-- Show only new uncovered code
    |       +-- Highlight regression areas
    |
    +-- IF violations detected:
    |   |
    |   +-- Check enforcement level:
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- STRICT:
    |   |   |   +-- BLOCK on overall threshold miss
    |   |   |   +-- BLOCK on new code threshold miss
    |   |   |   +-- BLOCK on critical file under-coverage
    |   |   |   +-- BLOCK on coverage regression
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- BALANCED:
    |   |   |   +-- BLOCK on critical threshold miss
    |   |   |   +-- WARN on overall threshold miss
    |   |   |   +-- REQUIRE new code meets threshold
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- PROTOTYPE:
    |   |       +-- LOG all violations
    |   |       +-- PASS unconditionally
    |   |
    |   +-- Generate actionable report:
    |   |   +-- Coverage Summary:
    |   |   |   +-- Overall: {current}% (required: {threshold}%)
    |   |   |   +-- New Code: {new_coverage}% (required: {new_threshold}%)
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Files Below Threshold:
    |   |   |   +-- {file}: {coverage}% (required: {threshold}%)
    |   |   |   +-- Uncovered lines: {line_ranges}
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Test Recommendations:
    |   |   |   +-- Add tests for: {uncovered_functions}
    |   |   |   +-- Cover branches: {uncovered_branches}
    |   |   |
    |   |   +-- Commands to Improve:
    |   |       +-- pytest {file} --cov={module} --cov-report=term-missing
    |   |       +-- Add test cases for lines: {line_numbers}
    |   |
    |   +-- IF auto-fix enabled:
    |   |   +-- Cannot auto-fix test coverage
    |   |   +-- Provide test template:
    |   |       +-- Generate skeleton test file
    |   |       +-- Include test stubs for uncovered functions
    |   |       +-- Mark with # TODO: Implement test
    |   |
    |   +-- IF blocking required:
    |       +-- BLOCK commit
    |       +-- Show coverage gap
    |       +-- Provide test templates
    |       +-- Exit with error
    |
    +-- Store coverage baseline:
    |   +-- Save coverage metrics to .sage/coverage-history.json
    |   +-- Track coverage over time
    |   +-- Enable trend analysis
    |
    +-- Generate validation report:
        +-- Coverage: {overall}%
        +-- Threshold: {threshold}%
        +-- Status: PASS/FAIL
        +-- New Code Coverage: {new_code}%
        +-- Files Tested: X/Y

        END

Rules:

- Minimum overall coverage: 80% (configurable)
- Minimum new code coverage: 90% (configurable)
- Critical files require 95% coverage
- No coverage regression allowed (STRICT mode)
- Test files required for all modules
- No empty tests or tests without assertions
- Coverage tool must be installed (pytest-cov or coverage.py)
- Tests must pass before coverage is assessed
- Auto-fix generates test templates only (manual implementation required)
- STRICT mode blocks on threshold violations
- BALANCED mode blocks on critical violations only
- PROTOTYPE mode logs only
- Coverage history tracked in .sage/coverage-history.json

Coverage Thresholds (Default):

- overall: 80%
- new_code: 90%
- per_file: 75%
- critical_files: 95%
- no_regression: true

Configuration (.coveragerc or pyproject.toml):

```toml
[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["."]
omit = ["tests/*", "*/migrations/*", "*/venv/*"]

[tool.coverage.report]
precision = 2
show_missing = true
skip_covered = false

[tool.coverage.sage]
minimum_coverage = 80
new_code_coverage = 90
fail_under = 80
critical_paths = ["core/*", "models/*", "auth/*"]
```

Test Anti-Patterns to Detect:

- Empty tests (only 'pass' statement)
- Tests without assertions
- @pytest.mark.skip without reason
- Overly broad try/except
- Tests that don't test anything
- Mocking everything (no real code tested)
- Tests with hardcoded success

Enforcement Actions:

- BLOCK: Prevent commit, coverage below threshold
- WARN: Log warning, allow to proceed
- LOG: Record for reference only
- TEMPLATE: Generate test skeleton (manual implementation required)
