  START: Secret Detection
    |
    +-- Initialize
    |   +-- Load secret patterns from rules/security-standards.md
    |   +-- Load allowlist (.sage/secrets-allowlist.json)
    |   +-- Get all files in changeset
    |
    +-- FOR each file:
    |   |
    |   +-- Read file content
    |   |
    |   +-- Skip binary files:
    |   |   +-- Check file type
    |   |   +-- IF binary: SKIP to next file
    |   |
    |   +-- Scan for secret patterns:

    |   |       +-- 2. Use .env file (add to .gitignore)
    |   |       +-- 3. Use secret management (AWS Secrets, Vault)
    |   |       +-- 4. Rotate exposed credentials immediately
    |   |       +-- 5. Scan git history: git log -p -S '<secret>'
    |   |
    |   +-- IF blocking required:
    |   |   +-- BLOCK commit
    |   |   +-- Display violation report
    |   |   +-- Exit with error
    |   |
    |   +-- IF warnings only:
    |   |   +-- Display warnings
    |   |   +-- Prompt for confirmation (interactive)
    |   |   +-- IF user confirms: ALLOW
    |   |   +-- IF user rejects: BLOCK
    |   |
    |   +-- Offer remediation:
    |       +-- Extract secrets to .env template
    |       +-- Update code to use env vars
    |       +-- Add to .gitignore if missing
    |
    +-- Check git history for leaked secrets:
    |   +-- IF secret found in current commit:
    |   |   +-- Scan git history for same secret
    |   |   +-- git log --all -p -S '<secret_pattern>'
    |   |   +-- IF found in history:
    |   |       +-- CRITICAL: "Secret already in git history"
    |   |       +-- Recommend: git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner
    |   |       +-- Recommend: Rotate credentials immediately
    |   |
    |   +-- ELSE: Secret is new, not yet leaked
    |
    +-- Generate scan report:
        +-- Files scanned: X
        +-- Secrets detected: Y
        +-- Blocked: Z
        +-- Allowlisted: N
        +-- Status: PASS/FAIL
        |
        END

Rules:

- Zero tolerance for CRITICAL secrets (cloud creds, private keys)
- Block HIGH severity in production branches
- All secrets must use environment variables or secret management
- .env files must be in .gitignore
- No credential files (.pem, .key, credentials.json) in repo
- Allowlist requires justification and expiration
- Check git history for already-leaked secrets
- Auto-fix: Extract to .env, update .gitignore
- Rotate compromised credentials immediately
- False positive filtering: test values, examples, env var references

Secret Pattern Categories:

1. API Keys (AWS, Google, GitHub, OpenAI, Stripe, etc.)
2. Passwords and credentials
3. Authentication tokens (Bearer, OAuth, JWT)
4. Private keys (RSA, SSH, PGP)
5. Database connection strings
6. Cloud credentials (AWS, Azure, GCP)
7. Webhook URLs (Slack, Discord)
8. High-entropy strings (>4.5 bits/char, >20 chars)

Allowlist Format (.sage/secrets-allowlist.json):

```json
{
  "allowlist": [
    {
      "pattern": "AKIA1234EXAMPLEKEY",
      "file": "tests/fixtures/test_data.py",
      "justification": "Test fixture, not real credential",
      "added_by": "developer@example.com",
      "added_at": "2025-01-15",
      "expires_at": "2026-01-15"
    }
  ]
}
```

Remediation Steps:

1. **Immediate**: Remove secret from code
2. **Rotate**: Generate new credentials
3. **Extract**: Move to .env or secret manager
4. **Update**: Use os.getenv() or similar
5. **Verify**: Ensure .gitignore covers .env
6. **History**: Check git history for leaks
7. **Clean**: Use BFG Repo-Cleaner if needed

Enforcement Actions:

- BLOCK: Prevent commit on CRITICAL/HIGH violations
- WARN: Display warning, prompt confirmation
- LOG: Record for audit only
- AUTO_FIX: Extract to .env template (manual completion)
- ROTATE: Recommend immediate credential rotation
