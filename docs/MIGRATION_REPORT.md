**Total Tickets Added:** 48

## Summary

Successfully migrated 4 component specifications with task breakdowns into the ticket system.

| Component | Epic ID | Stories | Total SP | Duration | Priority |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Enhanced Dependencies | DEPS-001 | 12 | 45 | 2 weeks | P0 |
| Ready-Work Detection | READY-001 | 10 | 31 | 1 week | P0 |
| Context Search | SEARCH-001 | 11 | 25 | 1 week | P1 |
| Skills Library | SKILLS-001 | 11 | 43 | 4 weeks | P1 |
| **TOTAL** | **4 epics** | **44 stories** | **144** | **8 weeks** | - |

## Ticket State Distribution

| State | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| UNPROCESSED | 48 | 100% |
| IN_PROGRESS | 0 | 0% |
| DEFERRED | 0 | 0% |
| COMPLETED | 0 | 0% |

All new tickets are UNPROCESSED (ready for implementation).

## Migration Mode Details

**Mode:** optimized (default)

- **All tickets full-detail:** Since all tickets are UNPROCESSED, all include complete validation configs
- **Token efficient:** Will use lightweight format for COMPLETED tickets in future
- **Implementation ready:** All tickets have story points, estimates, acceptance criteria, validation configs

## Component Details

### 1. Enhanced Dependencies (DEPS-001)

**Epic:** Enhanced Ticket Dependency System

**Goal:** Extend ticket schema with 4 dependency types (blocks, blockedBy, relatedTo, discoveredFrom)

**Story Tickets:**
- DEPS-002: Schema Extension (3 SP)
- DEPS-003: README Documentation (3 SP)
- DEPS-004: Cycle Detection Algorithm (5 SP) ⚠️ Complex
- DEPS-005: Orphan Detection (3 SP)
- DEPS-006: State Consistency Validation (3 SP)
- DEPS-007: blockedBy Computation (5 SP) ⚠️ Complex
- DEPS-008: Ready-Work Query (3 SP)

- DEPS-010: /sage.validate Integration (2 SP)
- DEPS-011: /sage.stream Integration (2 SP)
- DEPS-012: Unit Tests (5 SP)
- DEPS-013: Integration Tests (8 SP) ⚠️ Complex

**Critical Path:** DEPS-002 → DEPS-004 → DEPS-007 → DEPS-008 → DEPS-011 → DEPS-013

**Blocks:** READY-001 (Ready-Work Detection needs blockedBy field)

### 2. Ready-Work Detection (READY-001)

**Story Tickets:**
- READY-002: Ready-Work Query Engine (3 SP)
- READY-003: --dependency-aware Flag (2 SP)
- READY-004: Dynamic Re-Evaluation (3 SP)
- READY-005: Status Reporting (2 SP)

- SEARCH-009: Search Index (3 SP)
- SEARCH-010: Auto-Update Triggers (2 SP)
- SEARCH-011: Test Suite (3 SP)
- SEARCH-012: Documentation (2 SP)

**Critical Path:** SEARCH-002 → SEARCH-003-007 (parallel) → SEARCH-008 → SEARCH-011

**Dependencies:** None (independent component)

### 4. Skills Library (SKILLS-001)

**Epic:** Skills Library System

**Goal:** Reusable development skills with validation and /sage.implement integration

**Story Tickets:**
- SKILLS-002: Directory Structure (2 SP)

- SKILLS-009: /sage.implement Integration (5 SP)
- SKILLS-010: Enforcement Agent Validation (3 SP)
- SKILLS-011: Test Suite (5 SP)
- SKILLS-012: Documentation (3 SP)

**Critical Path:** CONTEXT-002 → SKILLS-002 → SKILLS-003 → SKILLS-004 → SKILLS-005 → SKILLS-009 → SKILLS-011

**Depends On:** CONTEXT-002 (.sage/agent/ directory)

## Dependency Graph

```plaintext
Phase 1 (Foundation):
  DEPS-001 (2 weeks) ──┐
                       ├─→ READY-001 (1 week)
                       │
  SEARCH-001 (1 week)  │   [Independent, can run parallel]
                       │
  CONTEXT-002 ─→ SKILLS-001 (4 weeks)

Critical Dependencies:
  - READY-001 BLOCKED BY DEPS-001
  - SKILLS-001 BLOCKED BY CONTEXT-002
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Recommended Execution Order:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Start: DEPS-001 (Enhanced Dependencies)
- Parallel: SEARCH-001 (Context Search)
- Total: 2 weeks with 2 engineers, or 3 weeks with 1 engineer

**Phase 2: Ready-Work Detection (Week 3)**
- Start: READY-001 (after DEPS-001 completes)
- Total: 1 week

**Phase 3: Skills Library (Weeks 4-7)**
- Start: SKILLS-001 (after CONTEXT-002 completes)
- Total: 4 weeks

**Total Duration:** 8 weeks with proper parallelization

## Story Point Distribution

| Component | P0 Tasks | P1 Tasks | Total SP |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| DEPS | 20 SP | 25 SP | 45 SP |
| READY | 10 SP | 21 SP | 31 SP |
| SEARCH | 12 SP | 13 SP | 25 SP |
| SKILLS | 21 SP | 22 SP | 43 SP |
| **TOTAL** | **63 SP** | **81 SP** | **144 SP** |

## Next Steps

1. **Review Dependencies:**
   - Verify CONTEXT-002 exists and is ready (for SKILLS-001)
   - Confirm DEPS-001 priority (blocks READY-001)

2. **Start Implementation:**
   ```bash
   # Start with highest priority, unblocked epic
   /sage.implement DEPS-001

   # Or use stream for automated execution
   /sage.stream --interactive

   # Or use dependency-aware mode (after DEPS-001 completes)
   /sage.stream --dependency-aware
   ```

3. **Parallel Execution:**
   ```bash
   # DEPS-001 and SEARCH-001 can run in parallel
   /sage.stream --parallel=2
   ```

4. **Monitor Progress:**
   ```bash
   /sage.progress
   ```

5. **Sync to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   /sage.sync
   ```

## Files Created/Modified

- ✓ `.sage/tickets/index.json` - Updated with 48 new tickets
- ✓ `docs/MIGRATION_REPORT.md` - This report
- ✓ `migrate_tickets.py` - Migration script (can be deleted)

## Validation

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| All specs have epic tickets | ✓ Pass |
| All tasks have story tickets | ✓ Pass |
| Dependencies mapped correctly | ✓ Pass |
| Story points assigned | ✓ Pass |
| Validation configs present | ✓ Pass |
| Priority set appropriately | ✓ Pass |
| Documentation references | ✓ Pass |

## Migration Statistics

- **Source Files Processed:** 12 (4 specs, 4 plans, 4 tasks)
- **Tickets Generated:** 48 (4 epics, 44 stories)
- **Total Story Points:** 144
- **Total Estimated Hours:** 576
- **Average SP per Story:** 3.27
- **Components:** 4
- **Dependencies Mapped:** 6 inter-component dependencies

## Known Limitations

1. **No Individual .md Files:** Tickets stored only in index.json (reduces file clutter)
2. **Subtask Granularity:** Each story ticket represents a complete task from tasks.md
3. **Legacy Data:** No existing git history for these new components (all UNPROCESSED)

## Recommendations

1. **Start with DEPS-001:** Foundation component that unblocks READY-001
2. **Parallel Work:** Run SEARCH-001 in parallel with DEPS-001 if 2 engineers available
3. **Test Early:** DEPS-004 (cycle detection) and DEPS-007 (blockedBy computation) are complex - test thoroughly
4. **Documentation First:** Ensure CONTEXT-002 completes before starting SKILLS-001
