## Critical Path

```plaintext
CONTEXT-002 ‚Üí SKILLS-002 ‚Üí SKILLS-003 ‚Üí SKILLS-004 ‚Üí SKILLS-005 ‚Üí SKILLS-009 ‚Üí SKILLS-011
              (2d)         (3d)          (8d)          (5d)          (5d)          (5d)
                                    [28 days / 4 weeks]
```

**Bottlenecks:**
- CONTEXT-002: External dependency (blocks start)
- SKILLS-004: Highest effort (8 SP), quality-critical
- SKILLS-005: Blocks integration work
- SKILLS-009: Complex integration logic

**Parallel Tracks:**
- Commands: SKILLS-005, 006, 007 can be built in parallel after SKILLS-004
- Validation: SKILLS-008 can run parallel with command development
- Integration: SKILLS-010 can run parallel with SKILLS-009 if interfaces defined

---

## Quick Wins (Week 1)

1. **SKILLS-002 (Directory Structure)** - Unblocks all work
2. **SKILLS-003 (Template)** - Enables parallel skill creation
3. **SKILLS-006 (Search)** - Quick value, independent

## Risk Mitigation

| Task | Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| SKILLS-004 | Seed skills low quality | Peer review, iterate with team feedback | Start with 3 skills instead of 5, add more later |
| SKILLS-009 | Integration breaks /sage.implement | Careful testing, make suggestions optional | Make skill suggestions manual command, defer integration |
| SKILLS-010 | Enforcement agents not available | Check agent availability before validation | Skip validation if agents missing, log warning |
| SKILLS-011 | Community adoption low | Focus on internal value first, marketing later | Document internal wins, share externally when mature |

---

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing Tasks
- **SKILLS-011 (Test Suite)** - 5 SP, Sprint 2

### Quality Gates
- All 5 seed skills peer-reviewed and validated
- All 3 commands working correctly
- Integration with /sage.implement tested
- 80%+ code coverage

## Sprint Planning

**2-week sprints, ~22 SP per sprint (for 1 engineer)**

| Sprint | Focus | Story Points | Key Deliverables |
|--------|-------|--------------|------------------|
| Sprint 1 (Week 1-2) | Foundation + Commands | 27 SP | Directory structure, template, 5 seed skills, 3 commands, prerequisite validation |
| Sprint 2 (Week 3-4) | Integration + Quality | 16 SP | /sage.implement integration, enforcement validation, tests, docs |

**Note:** Sprint 1 is over-allocated (27 SP). Either:
- Extend to 3 weeks total
- Reduce seed skills from 5 to 3 in Sprint 1, add 2 more in Sprint 2
- Add 0.5 engineer for skill creation in Sprint 1
