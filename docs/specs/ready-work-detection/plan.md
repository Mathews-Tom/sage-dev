**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- 80%+ reduction in manual ticket filtering
- Zero execution of blocked tickets
- 100% accuracy in dependency resolution

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

### Integration with `/sage.stream`

**Current Flow (without dependency awareness):**
```
Step 1: Load all UNPROCESSED tickets
Step 2: Display first ticket
Step 3: Confirm and execute
Step 4: Mark COMPLETED
Step 5: Loop to Step 1
```

**Enhanced Flow (with dependency awareness):**
```
Step 0: Mode detection (--dependency-aware flag)
Step 1: Load READY tickets (unblocked UNPROCESSED)
Step 1.5: Display ready vs. blocked status
Step 2: Display first READY ticket
Step 3: Confirm and execute
Step 4: Mark COMPLETED
Step 4.5: Re-evaluate dependencies (recompute blockedBy)
Step 5: Loop to Step 1 (re-query ready tickets)
```

### Component Architecture

**Core Components:**

1. **Ready-Work Query Engine** (`.sage/lib/ready-work-query.sh`)
   - Filters UNPROCESSED tickets
   - Checks `blockedBy` field
   - Validates blocker states (all COMPLETED)
   - Returns ordered list by priority

2. **Dependency Re-Evaluator** (enhancement to existing `.sage/lib/resolve-dependencies.sh`)
   - Recomputes `blockedBy` after ticket completion
   - Identifies newly unblocked tickets
   - Updates queue dynamically

3. **Status Reporter** (`commands/sage.stream.md` enhancement)
   - Shows ready vs. blocked ticket counts
   - Explains why tickets are blocked
   - Displays unblock chain

### Data Flow

**Ready-Work Query Flow:**
```bash
Input: .sage/tickets/index.json

Filter 1: state == "UNPROCESSED"
  ‚Üì
Filter 2: blockedBy == [] OR blockedBy contains only COMPLETED tickets
  ‚Üì
Sort: Priority (P0 > P1 > P2)
  ‚Üì
Output: ["DEPS-001", "SEARCH-001", "CONTEXT-002"]
```

**Dynamic Re-Evaluation:**
```bash
Ticket DEPS-001 marked COMPLETED
  ‚Üì
Recompute blockedBy for all tickets
  ‚Üì
READY-001: blockedBy was ["DEPS-001"], now []
  ‚Üì
Re-query ready work
  ‚Üì
READY-001 now appears in queue
```

## üíª Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Ready-Work Query Engine (Week 1)

**Create:** `.sage/lib/ready-work-query.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Query for tickets ready to execute

TICKET_INDEX="${1:-.sage/tickets/index.json}"

# Ready tickets: UNPROCESSED + no active blockers
jq -r '
  .tickets[] |
  select(
    .state == "UNPROCESSED" and
    (
      (.blockedBy // []) as $blockers |
      if ($blockers | length) == 0 then
        true
      else
        # Check all blockers are COMPLETED
        $blockers | map(
          . as $blocker_id |
          (input.tickets | map(select(.id == $blocker_id and .state == "COMPLETED")) | length > 0)
        ) | all
      end
    )
  ) |
  # Sort by priority (P0 > P1 > P2)
  .id
' "$TICKET_INDEX" | jq -s 'sort_by(.priority)'
```

**Performance Optimization:**
```bash
# For 100+ tickets, cache blocker states
declare -A BLOCKER_STATES

while read ticket_id; do
  state=$(jq -r ".tickets[] | select(.id == \"$ticket_id\") | .state" "$TICKET_INDEX")
  BLOCKER_STATES["$ticket_id"]="$state"
done < <(jq -r '.tickets[].id' "$TICKET_INDEX")

# Use cache in ready-work query
for blocker in "${blockers[@]}"; do
  [[ "${BLOCKER_STATES[$blocker]}" == "COMPLETED" ]] || is_blocked=true
done
```

### Phase 2: Stream Integration (Week 1)

**Modify:** `commands/sage.stream.md`

**Step 0: Mode Detection**
```bash
# Parse --dependency-aware flag
DEPENDENCY_AWARE=false
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
  case $1 in
    --dependency-aware)
      DEPENDENCY_AWARE=true
      shift
      ;;
    *)
      shift
      ;;
  esac
done

# Display mode
if [[ "$DEPENDENCY_AWARE" == "true" ]]; then
  echo "üîÑ Dependency-Aware Mode: Only ready work will be processed"
fi
```

**Step 1: Load Tickets (Enhanced)**
```bash
if [[ "$DEPENDENCY_AWARE" == "true" ]]; then
  # Use ready-work query
  TICKET_QUEUE=$(bash .sage/lib/ready-work-query.sh)
  READY_COUNT=$(echo "$TICKET_QUEUE" | wc -l)

  # Count blocked tickets
  TOTAL_UNPROCESSED=$(jq '[.tickets[] | select(.state == "UNPROCESSED")] | length' .sage/tickets/index.json)
  BLOCKED_COUNT=$((TOTAL_UNPROCESSED - READY_COUNT))

  echo "üìä Queue Status: $READY_COUNT ready, $BLOCKED_COUNT blocked"
else
  # Current behavior: all UNPROCESSED
  TICKET_QUEUE=$(jq -r '.tickets[] | select(.state == "UNPROCESSED") | .id' .sage/tickets/index.json)
fi
```

**Step 4.5: Dynamic Re-Evaluation (New)**
```bash
# After marking ticket COMPLETED
echo "‚Üí Recomputing dependencies..."
bash .sage/lib/resolve-dependencies.sh

# Show newly unblocked tickets
NEWLY_READY=$(comm -13 \
  <(echo "$PREVIOUS_READY" | sort) \
  <(bash .sage/lib/ready-work-query.sh | sort))

if [[ -n "$NEWLY_READY" ]]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Unblocked: $NEWLY_READY"
fi
```

### Phase 3: Status Reporting (Week 1)

**Add:** `--explain` flag to stream

```bash
# /sage.stream --explain SKILLS-003
if [[ -n "$EXPLAIN_TICKET" ]]; then
  TICKET_DATA=$(jq ".tickets[] | select(.id == \"$EXPLAIN_TICKET\")" .sage/tickets/index.json)
  STATE=$(echo "$TICKET_DATA" | jq -r '.state')
  BLOCKERS=$(echo "$TICKET_DATA" | jq -r '.blockedBy[]?' 2>/dev/null)

  echo "üìã Ticket: $EXPLAIN_TICKET"
  echo "State: $STATE"

  if [[ -n "$BLOCKERS" ]]; then
    echo "Status: ‚è∏Ô∏è  BLOCKED"
    echo ""
    echo "Blocking Dependencies:"
    for blocker in $BLOCKERS; do
      blocker_state=$(jq -r ".tickets[] | select(.id == \"$blocker\") | .state" .sage/tickets/index.json)
      blocker_title=$(jq -r ".tickets[] | select(.id == \"$blocker\") | .title" .sage/tickets/index.json)
      echo "  - $blocker ($blocker_state): $blocker_title"
    done
  else
    echo "Status: ‚úÖ READY"
  fi

  exit 0
fi
```

### Phase 4: Dry-Run Preview (Week 1)

**Add:** `--dry-run` mode with execution plan

```bash
# /sage.stream --dependency-aware --dry-run
if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == "true" ]]; then
  echo "üîç Execution Plan (Dry Run)"
  echo ""

  # Show batches by dependency level
  level=1
  while [[ -n "$READY_TICKETS" ]]; do
    echo "Batch $level (Ready Now):"
    echo "$READY_TICKETS" | while read ticket_id; do
      title=$(jq -r ".tickets[] | select(.id == \"$ticket_id\") | .title" .sage/tickets/index.json)
      echo "  $level. $ticket_id - $title"
    done

    # Simulate completion, find next ready
    # (Increment level, continue until no tickets remain)
    ((level++))
  done

  echo ""
  echo "No tickets will be executed (dry-run mode)."
  exit 0
fi
```

## üîß Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Version | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Query Engine | jq | 1.6+ | JSON querying, already in use |
| Orchestration | Bash | 5.0+ | Consistent with existing commands |
| Dependency Resolution | From DEPS-001 | - | Reuses enhanced-dependencies logic |

**Key Technology Decisions:**
- **jq for queries:** Fast, expressive, no new dependencies
- **Bash for integration:** Seamless integration with existing `/sage.stream`
- **No new storage:** Uses existing `.sage/tickets/index.json`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Core Implementation
- [ ] Ready-work query engine (`.sage/lib/ready-work-query.sh`)
- [ ] `--dependency-aware` flag parsing in `/sage.stream`
- [ ] Dynamic re-evaluation after completions
- [ ] Status reporting (ready vs. blocked counts)

### Week 1: Enhanced Features
- [ ] `--explain <ticket-id>` for blocking reasons
- [ ] `--dry-run` execution plan preview
- [ ] Performance optimization (caching)
- [ ] Documentation updates

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Query performance degrades with 1000+ tickets | High | Medium | Cache blocker states, optimize jq queries, SQLite in Phase 3 |
| False positives (blocked tickets marked ready) | Critical | Low | Comprehensive testing, validation before release |
| Complex dependency graphs confuse users | Medium | Medium | `--explain` flag, visual graphs (future), clear docs |
| Breaking existing workflows | High | Low | Opt-in flag, backward compatible, no changes without flag |

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Ready-work query with no blockers ‚Üí All UNPROCESSED returned
- Ready-work query with active blockers ‚Üí Blocked tickets excluded
- Ready-work query with COMPLETED blockers ‚Üí Unblocked tickets included
- Priority sorting ‚Üí P0 before P1 before P2

### Integration Tests
- Complete DEPS-001 ‚Üí READY-001 appears in ready-work queue
- Multiple blockers ‚Üí Ticket ready only when all COMPLETED
- Mixed states ‚Üí Handles COMPLETED, IN_PROGRESS, DEFERRED blockers correctly

### Edge Cases
- All tickets blocked ‚Üí Empty queue, clear message
- No UNPROCESSED tickets ‚Üí Empty queue, "All work complete" message
- Ticket blocks itself ‚Üí Caught by DEPS-001 validation
- Long dependency chain (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíD‚ÜíE) ‚Üí Correct execution order
