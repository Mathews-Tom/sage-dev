# Stream Semi-Auto Mode Implementation

**Feature/Ticket:** STREAM-001
**Created:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Owner:** sage-dev team

---

## Overview

Implement component-level automation for /stream command to reduce user fatigue while maintaining control at logical boundaries.

**Problem Statement:**
Interactive mode requires 50+ confirmations for a typical 10-ticket component, causing fatigue and slowing development velocity. Full auto mode lacks user control at critical decision points.

**Solution Approach:**
Group tickets by component prefix (AUTH-*, UI-*, API-*) and provide confirmations at component boundaries. Auto-process tickets within each component while allowing pause/resume between components.

---

## Objectives

### Primary Goals

- Reduce confirmation count by 90% (from 50+ to 4-6 per component)
- Maintain user control at component boundaries
- Enable pause/resume for long-running streams

### Success Metrics

- Execution speed: 3-5× faster than interactive mode
- Confirmation reduction: 90% vs interactive
- Component grouping accuracy: 100% for standard prefixes
- Resume reliability: 100% state preservation

### Non-Goals

- Automatic dependency resolution across components
- Parallel execution within semi-auto mode (separate feature)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Component Grouping

**Duration:** 1 week

**Tasks:**
1. Parse ticket IDs to extract component prefix
2. Group tickets by component into batches
3. Write batches to .sage/batches/*.batch files

**Deliverables:**
- Component prefix extraction logic
- Batch file creation mechanism
- Validation for batch integrity

### Phase 2: Component-Level Confirmations

**Duration:** 1 week

**Tasks:**
1. Add "start component" confirmation handler
2. Add "push component" confirmation handler
3. Add "continue to next component" confirmation handler

**Deliverables:**
- Three confirmation handlers
- Progress indicators for component execution
- Pause/resume state management

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation

**Duration:** 1 week

**Tasks:**
1. Test with multi-component ticket sets
2. Verify pause/resume functionality
3. Update documentation and examples

**Deliverables:**
- Test results for 3+ component scenarios
- Updated stream.md documentation
- User guide with examples

## Architecture

### System Components

```
User Input → Component Grouping → Batch Creation
                                       ↓
                              Component Execution Loop
                                       ↓
                     Confirmation Handler → Pause/Resume
                                       ↓
                              Ticket Processing (Auto)
                                       ↓
                              Component Summary
```

### Key Interfaces

- **Batch Files:** `.sage/batches/<component>.batch` - JSON array of ticket IDs
- **Confirmation Handlers:** Bash functions for start/push/continue prompts
- **Component Summary:** Metrics display after component completion

### Data Flow

1. Parse all UNPROCESSED tickets and extract component prefixes
2. Group tickets by prefix into batch arrays
3. For each component batch, prompt user to start
4. Auto-process all tickets in batch without confirmation
5. Display component summary and prompt to continue

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- stream.md (existing stream command)
- .sage/tickets/index.json (ticket system)

### External Dependencies

- jq (JSON processing)
- git (commit management)

### Blockers

- None (all dependencies satisfied)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Coverage Target:** N/A (Bash script)

**Key Test Cases:**
1. Component prefix extraction from various formats
2. Batch file creation and validation
3. Confirmation handler behavior

### Integration Tests

**Scenarios:**
1. Process 3 components with 5 tickets each
2. Pause after first component, resume later
3. Handle component with single ticket
4. Handle ticket without component prefix

### End-to-End Tests

**User Flows:**
1. /stream --semi-auto with multi-component tickets
2. Pause during execution, verify state, resume
3. Complete entire stream with component confirmations

### Performance Tests

**Benchmarks:**
- Component grouping: < 1s for 50 tickets
- Batch file creation: < 0.5s per component
- Confirmation latency: < 100ms

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Batch file corruption | High | Low | Validate JSON before execution, backup state |
| Resume failure | Medium | Low | Idempotent batch loading, state verification |
| Component grouping error | Medium | Medium | Validate prefixes, allow manual override |

### User Experience Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Unexpected pause points | Medium | Low | Clear documentation of component boundaries |
| Loss of progress indication | Low | Low | Display component N/M and ticket progress |

## Decision Log

### Decision 1: Component Prefix Format

**Date:** 2025-10-09

**Context:**
Need to determine how to extract component from ticket IDs like "AUTH-001", "ui-dashboard-002", "BACKEND_API_003".

**Decision:**
Use pattern `^([A-Z]+)-` for standard format. Fall back to "MISC" for non-standard IDs.

**Rationale:**
- 95% of tickets follow COMPONENT-### format
- Simple regex extraction
- Graceful fallback for edge cases

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Full parsing with multiple separators: Too complex, edge cases
- Manual component tagging: Too much overhead for users

### Decision 2: Batch File Location

**Date:** 2025-10-09

**Context:**
Where to store component batch files - in .sage/batches/ or .sage/agent/research/?

**Decision:**
Use .sage/batches/ directory (already in .gitignore).

**Rationale:**
- Transient state files, should not be version controlled
- Consistent with other .sage/ state directories
- Easy cleanup without affecting documentation

**Alternatives Considered:**
- .sage/agent/research/: Wrong semantics, research is for analysis not state
- .sage/stream-state/: New directory overhead, batches fits existing pattern
