## üé´ Enhanced Ticket System (Advanced)

The ticket-based workflow now includes advanced validation, sub-task processing, and component-level checkpointing for robust automated development.

### Ticket Types & Validation Types

Every ticket has TWO types that determine how it's implemented and validated:

#### Ticket Types (What Kind of Work)

| Type | Purpose | When to Use | Example |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **implementation** | Build new features from scratch | New components, APIs, UI pages | "Build User Authentication System" |
| **enhancement** | Improve existing features | Performance optimizations, UX improvements | "Add OAuth2 support to existing auth" |
| **bugfix** | Fix defects in existing code | Production bugs, test failures | "Fix memory leak in session cleanup" |
| **refactor** | Improve code quality without changing behavior | Code cleanup, architecture improvements | "Migrate auth module to TypeScript" |

#### Validation Types (How to Validate)

| Type | Purpose | Auto-Fix | Best For | Example |
|------|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| **stateflow** | Stateful behavior chains & UI cascades | ‚úì | Auth flows, state management | Login ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí UI updates |
| **content** | Field data, calculations, displayed values | ‚úì | Percentages, counters, statistics | Completion % calculation |
| **interactive** | Buttons, links, forms, event handlers | ‚úì | User interactions, form submissions | "Add Project Creation Button" |
| **integration** | External APIs, third-party services | ‚úó | GitHub integration, external APIs | "Implement GitHub Issue Sync" |
| **generic** | Standard implementation (default) | ‚úì | General features, mixed requirements | "Implement User Profile Page" |

### Sub-Task Processing

Tickets can contain fine-grained **tasks** arrays for atomic execution and validation:

```json
{
  "id": "AUTH-001",
  "title": "Implement Authentication System",
  "type": "implementation",
  "validation_type": "stateflow",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "TASK-001-1",
      "type": "interactive",
      "description": "Implement login button handler",
      "status": "UNPROCESSED",
      "validation_script": "npm test -- LoginButton.test",
      "auto_fix": true,
      "max_retries": 3
    },
    {
      "id": "TASK-001-2",
      "type": "stateflow",
      "description": "Validate auth state cascade",
      "status": "UNPROCESSED",
      "validation_script": "npm test -- AuthFlow.test",
      "auto_fix": true,
      "max_retries": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

**Sub-Task Processing Flow:**

```
1. SELECT_NEXT_TASK (status: UNPROCESSED)
2. IMPLEMENT_TASK
3. RUN_VALIDATION_SCRIPT
4. If validation fails ‚Üí AUTO_FIX_LOOP (max 3 attempts)
5. If still failing ‚Üí DEFER_TASK (continue to next)
6. If passes ‚Üí COMMIT_TASK (atomic commit)
7. MARK_TASK_COMPLETE
8. Repeat until all tasks complete
```

### Component-Level Checkpointing

Tickets can group related work into **components** for selective rollback:

```json
{
  "id": "AUTH-001",
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "AuthModule",
      "description": "Core authentication logic",
      "checkpoint_id": "abc123def",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "tasks": ["TASK-001-1", "TASK-001-2"]
    },
    {
      "name": "AuthUI",
      "description": "Authentication UI components",
      "checkpoint_id": "",
      "status": "UNPROCESSED",
      "tasks": ["TASK-001-3", "TASK-001-4"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Component Processing (Interactive Mode):**

```
1. PROCESS_COMPONENT_A
2. Execute all tasks for component
3. CREATE_COMPONENT_CHECKPOINT (git commit with file tracking)
4. REQUEST_USER_CONFIRMATION
5. User reviews ‚Üí Accept/Rollback/Quit
6. If rollback ‚Üí RESTORE_COMPONENT_CHECKPOINT
7. If accept ‚Üí MARK_COMPONENT_COMPLETE
8. Proceed to next component
```

### Auto-Fix Loop

When validation scripts fail, the system automatically attempts fixes (max 3 attempts):

```
VALIDATION_FAILED
  ‚Üì
Attempt 1 ‚Üí Analyze error ‚Üí Generate fix ‚Üí Apply ‚Üí Validate
  ‚Üì (still failing)
Attempt 2 ‚Üí Alternative fix ‚Üí Apply ‚Üí Validate
  ‚Üì (still failing)
Attempt 3 ‚Üí Final fix attempt ‚Üí Apply ‚Üí Validate
  ‚Üì (still failing)
DEFER_TASK (with categorized reason)
```

**Defer Reasons:**
- `missing_dependencies` - Required files/modules not found
- `persistent_test_failure` - Tests fail after 3 fix attempts
- `validation_script_error` - Validation command itself failed
- `external_blocker` - External service unavailable
- `user_rejected` - Component rejected in interactive mode

### Validation Commands

#### `/validate` - System Integrity Check

Validates ticket system before destructive operations:

```bash
/validate

# Checks:
# ‚úì Valid JSON schema
# ‚úì No duplicate IDs
# ‚úì All required fields present
# ‚úì Ticket type values valid (implementation/enhancement/bugfix/refactor)
# ‚úì Validation type values valid (stateflow/content/interactive/integration/generic)
# ‚úì Sub-task schema valid
# ‚úì Validation scripts well-formed
# ‚úì Component checkpoints valid
# ‚úì Dependencies valid
# ‚úì No circular dependencies
```

#### `/quality` - Quality Scoring

Scores ticket system quality (0-100):

```bash
/quality --command=tickets

# Ticket System Quality (100 points):
# - Sub-tasks have descriptions (10 pts)
# - Validation scripts exist for non-generic types (10 pts)
# - Auto-fix enabled appropriately (10 pts)
# - Component groupings logical (5 pts)
# - Validation types match content (15 pts)
```

#### `/repair` - Automatic Fixes

Repairs common ticket system issues:

```bash
/repair

# Repairs:
# ‚úì Deduplicate ticket IDs
# ‚úì Fix invalid states
# ‚úì Fix missing required fields (including validation_type)
# ‚úì Fix invalid ticket types
# ‚úì Fix invalid validation types (defaults to 'generic')
# ‚úì Fix sub-task schema
# ‚úì Clean orphaned component checkpoints
```

### Component Rollback

Granular rollback at component level (not just entire tickets):

```bash
# Rollback specific component only
/rollback --component=AuthUI

# Rollback entire ticket
/rollback --ticket=AUTH-001

# Full system rollback
/rollback
```

**Use Case:**
```bash
# Ticket AUTH-001 has two components: AuthModule ‚úì, AuthUI ‚úó
# AuthModule works perfectly, but AuthUI has bugs

# Rollback only AuthUI
/rollback --component=AuthUI

# Result:
# - AuthModule preserved (still COMPLETED)
# - AuthUI reverted to UNPROCESSED
# - Files modified by AuthUI restored from checkpoint
# - AuthUI tasks reset

# Re-implement AuthUI with fixes
/stream --ticket=AUTH-001 --component=AuthUI
```

### Enhanced /migrate Command

Generates enhanced ticket schema with validation types, sub-tasks, and components:

**Validation Type Detection (Automatic):**
```bash
# Analyzes task descriptions for keywords:
# "auth|login|state|flow|cascade" ‚Üí validation_type: stateflow
# "percentage|calculation|counter|total" ‚Üí validation_type: content
# "button|click|form|link|handler" ‚Üí validation_type: interactive
# "github|api|integration|external" ‚Üí validation_type: integration
# Otherwise ‚Üí validation_type: generic
```

**Sub-Task Generation:**
```bash
# Reads docs/specs/component/tasks.md
# Each task becomes a sub-task with:
# - Unique ID (TASK-XXX-N)
# - Validation type (inherited or specific)
# - Validation script (auto-generated based on project type)
# - Auto-fix enabled (true for stateflow/content/interactive)
# - Max retries: 3
```

**Component Grouping Strategy:**
```bash
# Groups tasks by logical components from breakdown or spec structure
# Example: Auth ticket ‚Üí AuthModule + AuthUI components
```

### Enhanced /stream Command

Processes tickets with sub-task execution, validation, and auto-fix:

**New Execution Flow:**

```
1. Load ticket
2. Check for sub-tasks array
3. If sub-tasks exist:
   3a. For each sub-task (status: UNPROCESSED):
       - Spawn sub-agent to implement
       - Run validation script
       - If fails ‚Üí AUTO_FIX_LOOP (max 3 attempts)
       - If passes ‚Üí COMMIT (atomic)
       - Update sub-task status to COMPLETED
       - Continue to next sub-task
   3b. If all sub-tasks complete ‚Üí Ticket COMPLETED
   3c. If some deferred ‚Üí Ticket IN_PROGRESS (manual intervention)
4. Else: Standard ticket processing (spawn single sub-agent)
```

**Interactive Component Confirmation:**

```bash
/stream  # Default: Interactive mode

# After completing each component:
# ================================================
# Component: AuthModule
# Status: COMPLETED
# Files modified: 3
# Tests passed: ‚úì
# ================================================
#
# Options:
#   [c] Continue to next component
#   [r] Rollback this component
#   [q] Quit (save checkpoint)
#
# Your choice: _
```

### Best Practices

**1. Choose Appropriate Validation Type:**

‚úÖ **Good:**
```yaml
# Auth flow with UI cascades
validation_type: stateflow
```

‚ùå **Bad:**
```yaml
# Auth flow with UI cascades
validation_type: generic  # Too generic, misses cascade validation
```

**2. Break Down Complex Tickets:**

‚úÖ **Good:**
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "TASK-1", "description": "Login button"},
    {"id": "TASK-2", "description": "Logout button"},
    {"id": "TASK-3", "description": "Auth state cascade"}
  ]
}
```

‚ùå **Bad:**
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "TASK-1", "description": "All auth functionality"}
  ]
}
```

**3. Enable Auto-Fix for Appropriate Types:**

‚úÖ **Enable auto-fix:**
- `stateflow` - UI cascade fixes
- `content` - Calculation corrections
- `interactive` - Handler wiring fixes

‚ùå **Disable auto-fix:**
- Security-sensitive code
- Production data migrations
- External API integrations (manual review)

**4. Use Component Grouping Wisely:**

‚úÖ **Good grouping:**
```json
"components": [
  {"name": "AuthLogic", "tasks": ["TASK-1", "TASK-2"]},
  {"name": "AuthUI", "tasks": ["TASK-3", "TASK-4"]}
]
```

‚ùå **Bad grouping:**
```json
"components": [
  {"name": "Everything", "tasks": ["TASK-1", "TASK-2", "TASK-3", "TASK-4"]}
]
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** `/specify` creates too many components  
**Solution:** Review and merge related components, re-run with clearer component boundaries

**Issue:** `/plan` recommendations don't match constraints  
**Solution:** Add constraint documentation to `docs/`, re-run command

**Issue:** `/tasks` estimates seem off  
**Solution:** Review velocity data, adjust based on team capacity, re-estimate

**Issue:** `/poc` asks unclear questions  
**Solution:** Provide more context in initial documentation, be specific about core concept

**Issue:** `/breakdown` too detailed for simple component  
**Solution:** Use for complex components only, simpler components can skip this

**Issue:** `/blueprint` shows unrealistic timeline
**Solution:** Review individual component plans, adjust scope or resources

**Issue:** `/commit` groups changes incorrectly  
**Solution:** Stage files manually before running, provide clearer change context

## üîÑ Workflow Transitions & Migration Guide

### When to Switch Workflows

**From Traditional to Ticket-Based:**

You should migrate when:

- ‚úÖ Manual implementation becomes tedious
- ‚úÖ You trust AI-driven automation
- ‚úÖ Ready to trade control for speed
- ‚úÖ Working solo or with AI-first team
- ‚úÖ Project is experimental/non-critical

**From Ticket-Based to Traditional:**

You should switch back when:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need more control over each step
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Working with team requiring reviews
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Project becomes production-critical
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation quality doesn't meet standards

### Migration Decision Tree

```

### Hybrid Workflow (Advanced)

You can combine both workflows for maximum flexibility:

**Scenario 1: Traditional Planning, Ticket Execution**

```bash
# Phase 1: Traditional planning (manual control)
/workflow  # Choose TRADITIONAL
/specify
/plan
/tasks
/breakdown  # Optional: detailed architecture

# Phase 2: Switch to automation
/migrate    # Convert tasks to tickets
/workflow  # Switch to TICKET_BASED
/stream          # Automated implementation
```

**Scenario 2: Ticket Automation with Manual Review**

```bash
# Setup ticket automation
/workflow  # Choose TICKET_BASED
/specify ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí /tasks ‚Üí /migrate

# Run automation in interactive mode (default)
/stream  # Review at each checkpoint

# Or preview first
/stream --dry-run  # See what would happen
/stream            # Execute with confirmations
```

**Scenario 3: Mixed Manual and Automated**

```bash
# Automated for most tickets
/stream  # Process bulk tickets

# Manual for critical/complex tickets
/implement TICKET-042  # Single ticket, full control
# ... review code, run tests manually ...
/commit
```

### Migration Checklist

#### Before Running `/migrate`

- [ ] ‚úÖ All specifications complete (`docs/specs/*/spec.md`)
- [ ] ‚úÖ All implementation plans exist (`docs/specs/*/plan.md`)
- [ ] ‚úÖ All task breakdowns created (`docs/specs/*/tasks.md`)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Tasks follow SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Clean git state (commit or stash changes)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Understand automation implications (AI will commit code)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Backup created (automatic via rollback mechanism)

#### After Migration

- [ ] ‚úÖ Verify `tickets/index.json` created
- [ ] ‚úÖ Verify ticket markdown files in `tickets/`
- [ ] ‚úÖ Check `.sage/workflow-mode` set to TICKET_BASED
- [ ] ‚úÖ Review ticket priorities and estimates
- [ ] ‚úÖ Sync with GitHub if using `/sync`

#### First `/stream` Run

- [ ] ‚úÖ Start with `--dry-run` to preview
- [ ] ‚úÖ Use interactive mode (default) first time
- [ ] ‚úÖ Review confirmation points (6 checkpoints)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Monitor ticket progress
- [ ] ‚úÖ Check rollback available if needed (`/rollback`)

### Common Transition Scenarios

#### Scenario A: New Project, Automation from Start

```bash
/workflow     # Choose TICKET_BASED
/specify
/plan
/tasks
/migrate       # Convert to tickets immediately
/stream --dry-run   # Preview automation
/stream             # Execute with confirmations
```

**Timeline:** Day 1 - Automation ready
**Best For:** Solo developers, experimental projects, fast prototyping

#### Scenario B: Existing Project, Gradual Migration

```bash
# Already have docs/specs/*/tasks.md from traditional workflow

/workflow     # Choose TICKET_BASED
/migrate       # Convert existing tasks
/stream --dry-run   # Preview first
/stream             # Start automation

# Can switch back anytime
/workflow     # Choose TRADITIONAL if needed
```

**Timeline:** Migration in minutes
**Best For:** Projects with complete task breakdowns, ready to accelerate

#### Scenario C: Traditional Workflow, Manual Control

```bash
/workflow     # Choose TRADITIONAL
/specify
/plan
/tasks
/breakdown             # Optional detailed design

# Implement manually, component by component
# ... write code, tests manually ...
/progress              # Check completion
/commit                # Manual commits
```

**Timeline:** Days to weeks (depends on scope)
**Best For:** Production systems, team projects, learning projects

#### Scenario D: Ticket Automation with Review Gates

```bash
/workflow     # Choose TICKET_BASED
/specify ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí /tasks ‚Üí /migrate

# Use interactive mode for control
/stream  # Default: 6 confirmation checkpoints
# 1. Start cycle
# 2. Before each ticket
# 3. After implementation
# 4. Before commit (optional diff review)
# 5. Before push
# 6. Continue/pause/stop

# Review code at each checkpoint
# Can defer tickets for manual review
```

**Timeline:** Faster than manual, safer than full auto
**Best For:** Solo developers wanting automation with oversight

### Transition Warning Signs

**Switch to Traditional if:**

- üö® Automation quality declining
- üö® Tests failing frequently
- üö® Need detailed code review at each step
- üö® Team collaboration requires manual coordination
- üö® Production criticality increased

**Switch to Ticket-Based if:**

- üöÄ Manual work feels repetitive
- üöÄ Confident in specifications and tests
- üöÄ Want faster iteration
- üöÄ Working alone or with AI-first team
- üöÄ Project is experimental/low-risk

### Rollback from Failed Migration

If `/migrate` fails or produces unexpected results:

```bash
/rollback  # Restore pre-migration state

# Fix issues in task files
# Re-run migration when ready
/migrate
```

Checkpoint includes:

- Git working directory
- tickets/index.json (if existed)
- All task files
- Workflow mode

### Workflow Mode Reference

**Check current mode:**

```bash
cat .sage/workflow-mode  # Shows TRADITIONAL or TICKET_BASED
```

**Switch mode:**

```bash
/workflow  # Interactive questionnaire
# Or manually:
echo "TRADITIONAL" > .sage/workflow-mode
echo "TICKET_BASED" > .sage/workflow-mode
```

**Mode validation:**

- `/implement` - Requires TICKET_BASED mode
- `/stream` - Requires TICKET_BASED mode
- `/migrate` - Sets mode to TICKET_BASED
- Other commands - Workflow agnostic
