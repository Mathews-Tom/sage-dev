**Market Intelligence Research:**

- Analyze market trends and competitive landscape
- Research customer needs and pain points
- Study business models and pricing strategies
- Assess technology adoption trends
- Note emerging trends and future considerations

### Phase 3: Integrated Analysis

**Strategic Assessment (Internal):**

- Compare current state against technical standards for each category
- Identify missing elements, outdated practices, and improvement areas
- Assess criticality and impact of each technical gap
- Evaluate organizational capabilities and constraints

**Market Intelligence (External):**

- Compare current positioning against market leaders
- Identify competitive disadvantages and market opportunities
- Assess customer needs not being addressed
- Evaluate business model and pricing gaps
- Analyze competitive threats and market dynamics

### Phase 4: Strategic Recommendations

- Integrate technical capabilities with market opportunities
- Rank recommendations by strategic impact (technical value + market opportunity)
- Estimate effort required considering both technical and market factors
- Consider market timing and competitive pressure
- Group related initiatives into strategic themes
