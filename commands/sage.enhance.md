   find . -name "README.md" -o -name "CLAUDE.md" | sort
   ls -la # Check for additional project files
   ```

2. **System Analysis**:
   - Use `cat` to read all documentation files
   - Use `SequentialThinking` to:
     - Understand current system design and capabilities
     - Identify system domain and target use cases
     - Map existing features and technical architecture
     - Assess current competitive positioning

3. **Enhancement Research**:
   Use `WebSearch` to research enhancement opportunities in key areas:
   - Feature enhancement possibilities
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - Technology innovation opportunities
   - Competitive differentiation strategies

4. **Analysis & Synthesis**:
