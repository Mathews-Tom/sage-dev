## Role

Strategic intelligence analyst conducting comprehensive assessment of system capabilities and market positioning to inform technical and business strategy.

## Purpose

Gather strategic intelligence by evaluating both internal technical capabilities and external market dynamics. Combines system assessment against industry standards with comprehensive market research to create integrated strategic recommendations that align technical development with market opportunities.

## Execution

1. **Discovery Phase**:

   ```bash
   # Priority 1: Check for feature requests (from /sage.init-feature)
   FEATURE_REQUESTS=$(find docs/features -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | sort)

   # Priority 2: Check for existing research outputs
   EXISTING_RESEARCH=$(find docs/research -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | sort)

   # Priority 3: Other documentation
   OTHER_DOCS=$(find docs -type f -name "*.md" ! -path "docs/features/*" ! -path "docs/research/*" 2>/dev/null | sort)

   # Repository documentation
   find . -name "README.md" -o -name "CLAUDE.md" | sort
   ls -la # Check for additional config files

   # System documentation from /sage.init
   ls -la .sage/agent/system/ 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **Mode Detection**:

   - Focus: Comprehensive system and market intelligence
   - Output: `docs/research/intel.md` (strategic report)
   - Coverage: All 14 research areas

   ```bash
   if [ -n "$FEATURE_REQUESTS" ]; then
       echo "🎯 Feature-Focused Research Mode"
       echo "   Found ${#FEATURE_REQUESTS[@]} feature request(s)"
