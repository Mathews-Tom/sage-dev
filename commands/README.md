# Claude Code Development Workflow

A systematic approach to software development from specifications to implementation using Claude Code slash commands.

## üìã Overview

This workflow provides a structured methodology for analyzing requirements, validating concepts, planning implementation, and managing development through a series of purpose-built slash commands.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

- **Documentation-Driven**: All decisions tracked and justified
- **Research-Backed**: Web search for best practices and patterns
- **Iterative Validation**: POC before heavy investment
- **Minimal Complexity**: Focus on core value, exclude non-essentials
- **Actionable Output**: Every document ready for immediate use

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Full Workflow (New Project)

**Scenario:** Starting a new project from scratch

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze requirements
/specify

# Step 2: Create technical plans
/plan

# Step 3: Break down into tasks
/tasks

# Step 4: Validate core concept
/poc

# Step 5: Detail implementation
/breakdown

# Step 6: Create system roadmap
/devflow

# Step 7: Start implementation
# ... development work ...

# Step 8: Commit changes
/commit
```

**Timeline:** Days 1-3 for documentation, then development

---

### Pattern 2: POC-First Approach

**Scenario:** High-risk project needing early validation

```bash
# Step 1: Quick requirements analysis
/specify

# Step 2: Immediate POC validation
/poc

# Step 3: If POC successful, full planning
/plan
/tasks
/breakdown
/devflow
```

**Timeline:** POC within 1 week, then full planning

---

### Pattern 3: Iterative Component Development

**Scenario:** Adding features to existing system

```bash
# Step 1: Specify new component
/specify

# Step 2: Plan integration
/plan

# Step 3: Create tasks
/tasks

# Step 4: Optional POC for risky features
/poc  # if needed

# Step 5: Implementation details
/breakdown

# Step 6: Update system roadmap
/devflow
```

**Timeline:** Per-component iteration cycle

---

### Pattern 4: Strategic Assessment

**Scenario:** Quarterly review or strategic planning

```bash
# Step 1: Strategic intelligence gathering
/strategic-intelligence  # Strategic assessment + market intelligence

# Step 2: Update plans based on strategic insights
/plan     # Update technical strategy
/tasks    # Adjust priorities and timeline
/devflow  # Update roadmap
```

**Timeline:** 1-2 days for comprehensive assessment

---

### Pattern 5: Documentation Update

**Scenario:** Requirements or technology changed

```bash
# Step 1: Update affected components
/specify  # Re-run for updated requirements
/plan     # Re-run for technology changes
/tasks    # Re-run for timeline updates

# Step 2: Update system view
/devflow
```

**Timeline:** Few hours for documentation sync

---

## üí° Best Practices

### Command Execution Order

1. **Always start with `/specify`**
   - Foundation for all subsequent work
   - Ensures shared understanding
   - Creates component boundaries

2. **Consider `/poc` early**
   - Run after `/specify` or `/plan`
   - Especially for novel/risky features
   - Fail fast on wrong assumptions

3. **Use `/breakdown` before coding**
   - Developers' implementation guide
   - Prevents rework and confusion
   - Ensures consistency

4. **Keep `/devflow` updated**
   - Re-run after major changes
   - Use for stakeholder updates
   - Track progress weekly

### When to Re-run Commands

| Command | Re-run When... |
|---------|---------------|
| `/specify` | Requirements change, new docs added |
| `/plan` | Technology choices need revision, architecture changes |
| `/tasks` | Timeline shifts, team changes, priorities update |
| `/poc` | Core assumptions need validation, pivot required |
| `/breakdown` | Implementation approach changes, new patterns adopted |
| `/devflow` | Component updates, integration changes, milestone reviews |
| `/strategic-intelligence` | Quarterly reviews, competitive changes, strategic planning |
| `/commit` | Code ready for PR, feature complete |

### Quality Gates

- [ ] Stakeholders informed

**After `/strategic-intelligence`:**

- [ ] Strategic capabilities and market position assessed
- [ ] Competitive positioning and market intelligence gathered
- [ ] Strategic ROI projections realistic

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Organize your documentation:**

```bash
mkdir -p docs
# Add your requirements, notes, research to docs/
```

2. **Run the workflow:**

```bash
/specify    # Generate specifications
/poc        # Validate core concept (optional but recommended)
/plan       # Create implementation plans
/tasks      # Break down into actionable tasks

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure workflow effectiveness:

### Process Metrics

- **Documentation Time:** Specify ‚Üí Implementation start
- **POC Success Rate:** % of POCs that validate successfully
- **Estimation Accuracy:** Planned vs actual timeline
- **Rework Reduction:** Less refactoring needed

### Quality Metrics

- **Requirement Clarity:** Fewer requirement changes
- **Technical Debt:** Lower complexity over time
- **Test Coverage:** Higher due to planned testing
- **Bug Rate:** Fewer production issues

### Team Metrics

- **Onboarding Time:** New developers productive faster
- **Communication:** Fewer clarification meetings
- **Alignment:** Team understands system better
- **Velocity:** More predictable sprint outcomes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** `/specify` creates too many components  
**Solution:** Review and merge related components, re-run with clearer component boundaries

**Issue:** `/plan` recommendations don't match constraints  
**Solution:** Add constraint documentation to `docs/`, re-run command

**Issue:** `/tasks` estimates seem off  
**Solution:** Review velocity data, adjust based on team capacity, re-estimate

**Issue:** `/poc` asks unclear questions  
**Solution:** Provide more context in initial documentation, be specific about core concept

**Issue:** `/breakdown` too detailed for simple component  
**Solution:** Use for complex components only, simpler components can skip this

**Issue:** `/devflow` shows unrealistic timeline  
**Solution:** Review individual component plans, adjust scope or resources

**Issue:** `/commit` groups changes incorrectly  
**Solution:** Stage files manually before running, provide clearer change context
