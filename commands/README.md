# Claude Code Development Workflow

A systematic approach to software development from specifications to implementation using Claude Code slash commands.

## üìã Overview

This workflow provides a structured methodology for analyzing requirements, validating concepts, planning implementation, and managing development through a series of purpose-built slash commands.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

- **Documentation-Driven**: All decisions tracked and justified
- **Research-Backed**: Web search for best practices and patterns
- **Iterative Validation**: POC before heavy investment
- **Minimal Complexity**: Focus on core value, exclude non-essentials
- **Actionable Output**: Every document ready for immediate use

   - Bridge gap between concept and formal requirements

2. **Always run `/specify` after enhancement research**
   - Foundation for all subsequent work
   - Incorporates enhancement insights into requirements
   - Creates component boundaries

3. **Consider `/poc` early**
   - Run after `/specify` or `/plan`
   - Especially for novel/risky features or enhancements
   - Fail fast on wrong assumptions

4. **Use `/breakdown` before coding**
   - Developers' implementation guide
   - Prevents rework and confusion

- **Technical Debt:** Lower complexity over time
- **Test Coverage:** Higher due to planned testing
- **Bug Rate:** Fewer production issues

### Team Metrics

- **Onboarding Time:** New developers productive faster
- **Communication:** Fewer clarification meetings
- **Alignment:** Team understands system better

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** `/specify` creates too many components  
**Solution:** Review and merge related components, re-run with clearer component boundaries

**Issue:** `/plan` recommendations don't match constraints  
**Solution:** Add constraint documentation to `docs/`, re-run command

**Issue:** `/tasks` estimates seem off  
**Solution:** Review velocity data, adjust based on team capacity, re-estimate

**Issue:** `/poc` asks unclear questions  
**Solution:** Provide more context in initial documentation, be specific about core concept

**Issue:** `/breakdown` too detailed for simple component  
**Solution:** Use for complex components only, simpler components can skip this

**Issue:** `/devflow` shows unrealistic timeline  
**Solution:** Review individual component plans, adjust scope or resources

**Issue:** `/commit` groups changes incorrectly  
**Solution:** Stage files manually before running, provide clearer change context
